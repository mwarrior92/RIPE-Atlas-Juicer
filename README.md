# RIPE-Atlas-Juicer
Platform to aggregate existing, public RIPE Atlas measurement data for custom measurements. 

# Purpose
Squeeze every last drop of utility form public RIPE Atlas measurements and simply conservation of RIPE Atlas credit. As a happy side-effect, this could also reduce load on the RIPE Atlas system (and, in turn, reduce whatever tiny load RIPE Atlas places on the sites it's measuring).

# About the Author
Marc Warrior (warrior@u.northwestern.edu) made it (and is currently still working on it). If you'd like to contribute your skills to the project, you're more than welcome to.

# Uses
1) find measurements using more refined search options than those (currently) offered by the RIPE Atlas platform
    -> Example: find the largest set of probes querying google.com in a 24 hour window between May 1st and May 15th 2015
                (which might, for example, return measurements from May 12th spanning 42 probes)
